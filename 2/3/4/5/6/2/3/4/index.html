            Anyways, I know you had a really long period that was a struggle but, now, you are making it and I'm proud of you as a 
            friend and as a person who witnessed all your failures and downs before your successes and ups.
            I want you to be the happiest today,you know I don't suck at making people happy and this is probably the only gift i 
            can give you, HAPPINESS..
            <br>
            I will be there whenever you seek me. <br> Always. Just be happy. <span style="color: goldenrod;">KWS</span> </p>
